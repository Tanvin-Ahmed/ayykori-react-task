# Recursive-partitioning

## Problem statement

- Create a responsive layout builder where there is an initial partition with a random color and two buttons named 'V' and 'H'.

- Clicking the 'V' button will split the initial partition vertically, and clicking the 'H' button will split it horizontally. After the split, one of the partitions will retain its old color, and the new partition will have a new random color.

- The new partitions created via splitting should also be further splittable, and if there are multiple partitions, any partition can be removed via a â€˜-' button. The partitions should be resizable by clicking and dragging.

- Optionally, the partitions could snap to 1/4, 1/2, and 3/4 ratios.

Implement the following functionality:

1. Start the challenge
2. Display an initial partition with 'V' and 'H' buttons
3. Successfully split the initial screen
4. Successfully split each partition further
5. Be able to remove any partition
6. Be able to resize the partitions
